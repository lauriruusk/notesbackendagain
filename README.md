this exercise has been a mess for me for a while. This is an attempt to make it less so

Core of this repository is from MOOC full stack course part 3.7, https://github.com/fullstack-hy/part3-notes-backend/tree/part3-7. From there, I continued onward. I had several
other repositories and folders for these same exercises, but due to constant confusion over which onee is actually working one, and couple accidental dletion of files, I figured 
it would be easier to just get a ready part and continue from there
